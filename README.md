# love_rts
A generic RTS interface for love2D.

The features implemented so far are very basic, and allow for a simple drag and drop selection of figures which then move around with right-click.

## Installation

Make sure to have LÖVE installed on your machine and to have the path set up. 
You can download LÖVE here: http://love2d.org/#download
Everything else should be ready to launch, with the usual LÖVE procedure.


## TODOs

* Have units "slide" next to each other rather than getting stuck
